- Implement terrain resistance map to mimic different materials
- Move settings to config file
- Add a parameter for the number of cycles to run the simulation for
- Add a parameter for the amount of upward slope that droplets can traverse
    - Hopefully will help to keep them from getting stuck
- Add displaying results with a gradient of multiple colors
- Add grouping and movement to rain pattern
    - Can I generate a voronoi texture?
- Make speed dependent on the slope droplets travel
    - Speed will affect the amount of sediment they deposit and leave
    - Also use impact speed to determine rainsplash erosion
